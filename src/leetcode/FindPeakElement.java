162. Find Peak Element

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given a 0-indexed 
integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, 
return the index to any of the peaks. You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -∞. 
In other words, an element is always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is 
outside the array. You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.

 

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, 
or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
